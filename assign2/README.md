Scrabble Game Scoring System
This project simulates a Scrabble game by randomly selecting 7 tiles and calculates possible word scores based on the Collins Scrabble Dictionary. The game evaluates all valid words that can be formed using the tiles and computes their scores based on individual letter values. Key features include:

Tile Selection: 7 random tiles are picked from a set of available characters.
Word Validation: Checks if words can be formed from the selected tiles using the Collins Scrabble Dictionary.
Scoring Logic: Calculates the score for each valid word based on predefined letter values.
Word List Generation: Returns a list of valid words that can be created from the tiles.
Sorting: Scores for each word are calculated and sorted in ascending order.
Tile Comparison: The equals() method compares two Scrabble sets to check if the tile combinations are identical.

This project demonstrates concepts like file I/O, string manipulation, array handling, and the use of helper methods in Java.
