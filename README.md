☕ Java Projects 🚀
Welcome to my Java projects repository! This folder contains four exciting projects that demonstrate various programming concepts like game design, pathfinding, data structures, and more. Below are the projects included in this directory:

🎲 Yahtzee Game
📝 Overview
A fully functional implementation of the classic Yahtzee game. Players roll dice and try to score the highest points by matching combinations of numbers across multiple rounds.

🔑 Key Features
Five dice to roll each turn.
Multiple scoring categories based on dice combinations.
Ability to replay and track the best score.
🧑‍💻 How to Play
Roll the dice up to 3 times per turn.
Choose which dice to keep and which to reroll.
Score the best combination in the scoring categories.
🧩 Scrabble Game
📝 Overview
This project simulates a Scrabble game, allowing players to place tiles on a board to form words and score points based on tile values.

🔑 Key Features
Supports placing tiles on a 15x15 grid.
Tracks word scores according to Scrabble's rules.
Validates word placement against a dictionary.
🧑‍💻 How to Play
Players take turns forming words using their tiles.
Place the word on the board and calculate the score.
The game ends when all tiles are used or no more valid moves are available.
🔠 Wordle Game
📝 Overview
This project replicates the Wordle game, where players attempt to guess a hidden word by entering guesses and receiving feedback on letter positions.

🔑 Key Features
Allows users to guess a mystery word.
Provides feedback for each guess: correct letters in the right position, wrong letters, or unused.
Game ends when the mystery word is guessed or after a set number of attempts.
🧑‍💻 How to Play
Enter a five-letter word to make a guess.
Use the feedback to narrow down the correct word.
You have a limited number of guesses to find the correct word.
🏰 Pyramid Chambers Pathfinding
📝 Overview
Navigate through a pyramid’s chambers to find treasures using a stack-based pathfinding algorithm. This project challenges you to determine the best route based on various constraints like lighting and sealed chambers.

🔑 Key Features
A pyramid map is represented as a collection of chambers with various states (lighted, sealed, treasure).
Pathfinding is done using a stack to explore accessible chambers.
The algorithm ensures that all reachable treasures are found based on constraints like lighting and chamber status.
🧑‍💻 How to Play
The program navigates through a pyramid map from the entrance to the treasure chambers.
The goal is to find the best path while meeting the constraints of the pyramid chambers.
The algorithm will explore and find treasures by marking chambers as "pushed" or "popped" during the process.
🔧 Getting Started
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the appropriate folder (e.g., Yahtzee, Scrabble, Wordle, Pyramid Chambers) for the project you want to run.
Follow the instructions specific to each project to build and play the games.
