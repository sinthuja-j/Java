Yahtzee Game Scoring System
This project implements the scoring functionality for the classic Yahtzee dice game. It simulates rolling five dice and calculates the scores based on various combinations, including three-of-a-kind, four-of-a-kind, full house, small/large straights, and Yahtzee. Key features include:

Dice Rolling: Random values are generated for five dice.
Scoring Logic: Calculates the score for each category, including special combinations.
Comparison & Output: Provides the highest score and its corresponding category index, and includes an equals() method to compare dice rolls.

This project demonstrates the use of arrays, object-oriented principles, and custom methods for game logic.
